# Frozen Pizza Studios Website
Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

## Development
- `zola serve --open` to preview the site locally as you work
- `zola build` before committing & pushing (subject to change)

## TODO
- Flesh out basic templates with pico.css
    - index
        - Minimal header with games & blog links
        - Logo, company title, short description
        - Side by side "Latest game" and "Latest post"
- Use GitHub actions rather than committing build output
- (stretch) Support comments through giscus
