# Frozen Pizza Studios Website
Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

## Development
- `zola serve --open` to preview the site locally as you work
- `zola build` before committing & pushing (subject to change)
- `git submodule update --remote themes/kita` to update the theme

## TODO
- Use GitHub actions rather than committing build output
- (stretch) Support comments through giscus
